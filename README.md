# CoreAndFrameworkProjC-7SyntaxNoPackageRef

this might be the only case where C#7 syntax can work in Antares nowadays  
since the new language need msbuild15, dotnet build will make it work   
and luckily there's no package reference in the lib, so even dotnet restore **failed** for  
".netframework project", there's no visible effects
